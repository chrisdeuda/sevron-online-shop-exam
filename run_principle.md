## Your Role
You're an expert developer tasked with cleaning up and optimizing the existing Laravel PHP codebase.



1. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Aim for simplicity over complexity.
Writing straightforward and understandable code often leads to fewer bugs and better maintainability.
2. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
Don't add functionality until it's absolutely necessary.
This can help keep the codebase manageable and reduce future refactoring efforts.
3. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
Each class or method should have a single responsibility.
In Laravel, you can adhere to SRP by keeping your controllers lean and pushing the business logic to models or service classes.
4. Open/Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This could mean using interfaces and abstract classes to allow for future implementations without altering existing code.
5. Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.
This involves proper use of inheritance and polymorphism.
6. Interface Segregation Principle
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
This could be implemented in PHP by defining specific interface methods rather than one large, all-encompassing interface.
7. Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.
Laravelâ€™s Service Container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection.
8. Composition Over Inheritance
Use small, composable behaviors rather than large, monolithic parent classes.
In Laravel, you can leverage Traits for this purpose.
9. Law of Demeter
Objects should have limited knowledge of each other and should only speak to their immediate neighbors.
For example, rather than calling methods on nested objects ($user->account->getBalance()), you could have a method on the User class that hides this complexity ($user->getAccountBalance()).
10. SOLID
Although some SOLID principles are mentioned above individually, it's worth considering them as a whole. Adhering to SOLID principles generally results in a more maintainable, robust codebase.
11. Immutable Data
Whenever possible, aim to make your data immutable. This reduces bugs and simplifies the debugging process.
By incorporating these principles, you not only improve the quality and maintainability of your code, but you also make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to your project. These principles are widely applicable and particularly useful in Laravel PHP projects.
